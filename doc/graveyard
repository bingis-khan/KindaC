LET GENERALIZATION AND MONOMORPHISM

-- this is more complicated than i thought
--  - unfortunately, right now, i have to compile even unused functions, because I don't know if they are executed.
--  - i can optimize it later, because this is more of an unusual case...
--    - where we check which functions get executed.
--    - ie trace the expression n shit and see if it's just a normal function
-- TODO: finish excuses

-- okay, so how should i do it?
-- 1. go through top level functions... IN REVERSE
--    1.5 there's a context
-- 2. gather variables and their types
--    2.1 scan for identifiers n shit
--    2.2 when reaching the variable that was used, replace the type with a tuple of types. ????
--    2.3 let's see what happens
