The problem of declaration ordering.

Let's assume my previous way to resolve variables for my language:


y = f(B(420, 1337)) # wtf?

class Dupsko
	f (x @) -> Int

Bob
	B Int Int


x = y

impl Dupsko Bob
	f (_) -> Int
		return x


Yeah, it has some holes.

So, right now, my idea is to do this:


class Dupsko
	f (x @) -> Int

Bob
	B Int Int

x = 1
impl Dupsko Bob
	f (_) -> Int
		return x

x = f(B(1, 2))


This also allows me to also do this:

everything_happens_locally (see)
	class Dupa
		f (x @) -> Int

	D
		A Int Int

	impl Dupa D
		f (_) -> Int
			return see

	d = A(420, 1337)
	return f(d)


Local definitions... see?
