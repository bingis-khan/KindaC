Objectives:

 - make it easy to interact with the AST. have all the information easily available.
	- through memoization
	- look at the usage patterns!
	- I think I should merge TyVared and Typed. The modules will be tyvared, and merged will be actually Typed.

 - proper use of type families? or remove them outright? or remove RECURSION SCHEMES?
	- by removing recursion schemes, we won't have a reason to keep type parameters.
	- we might also be able to keep some ASTs, so we won't have to duplicate printing procs.

 - remove pointless Show instances -> normal print functions
