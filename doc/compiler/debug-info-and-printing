How would I structure it?

Basically, for convenience, I should be able to display debugging info from each phase by function arguments.

Also, I need it for showing type info in errors n shit.


What should I do?

	1. reimplement printf for Context (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7828072/how-does-haskell-printf-work)
		(we need to make a special implementation, otherwise its arguments will lose that printing context)
	2. Make a special printing context Reader thing, which gets initialized in the beginning.
	3. args for controlling printing


fuk i cant focussssss


so, lets force it



I would start by creating the printing context after parsing args. The args will have a '--debug' option to set the context.

The PPContext is going to be a Reader CtxData.

should i put it in a different module than Def??????????????????
right now, ill keep it together.
