Unions are not very good. We keep uninstantiated unions - the current env filtering scheme is flat out incorrect. How would I fix this?

Like, envs are okay by default, but the contents of unions are not - they depend on what gets instantiated.
The current env filtering scheme seems to be incorrect (as we only filter by EnvID).
