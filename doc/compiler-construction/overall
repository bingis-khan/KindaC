i dunno, i'll try to keep my documentation consistent here.

this directory is meant to describe how the compiler was written (because I keep forgetting and I have some ideas which I also forget often)
	stuff like which data should be preserved in data structures
	comments on current implementation (eg. what each data structure is supposed to mean/do)
	possible problems etc.
	ideas
	how to implement it in a simpler procedural language
	etc


problems: things to watch out for
