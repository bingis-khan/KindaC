# Maybe I should disallow the `return` keyword for top level?
# Instead of writing (this is top level):

hadError = doSomeIO()

if hadError
	return 1


# A clearer way would be

hadError = doSomeIO()

if hadError
	exit(1)


# Maybe I can force this "good style"
# Plus, it's more functional!

# But both options are easy, so I don't care right now.
# Right now it's ALLOWED.
