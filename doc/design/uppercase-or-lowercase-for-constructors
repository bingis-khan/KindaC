# Should I allow uppercase variable names and lowercase constructor names?
# The only problem I found was:

T
	A
	B
	C

t = aOrBOrC()

case t
	A
		print 'a'

	B
		print 'b'

	C
		print 'c'

# Then, if we remove the 'A' constructor like this:

T
	B
	C

# Then case t will always match A, as it will be treated as a variable name.
# ehhh, i dunno
# also, which looks prettier

Maybe a
	Just a
	None


# or

Maybe a
	just a
	none

# But it's only a problem with enums

T
	A Int String
	# ...

# ...

case t
	A(x, y)
		print 'a'
		print x
		print y

# Okay, right now I'll decide to do only uppercase letters, as my language is principled already: (= vs <=)
# comparison example:

x = 1

Either a b
	Left a
	Right b

y = Left(1)

Maybe a
	Just a
	Nothing

x = Nothing

y = Just(1)

Maybe a
	just (Maybe a) a (Either a a)
	nothing
