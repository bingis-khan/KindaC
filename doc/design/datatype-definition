I have an idea for... ya guessed it... syntax.

# typical single constructor datatype (as is currently)
Tuple a b
	Tuple a b

# new proposed syntax - quick definition of single constructor types.
Tuple a b: Tuple a b

# also nice for newtype-like datatypes
Subst: Subst (Map TVar Type)

# type synonym
MyTuple = Tuple Int String

# downsides? because of type synonyms, we won't be able to destructure single-constructor types (it's pointless anyway, but still...)

# maybe we can have an exception - you have to add parenthesis:
Unit() = Unit  # empty deconstruction
