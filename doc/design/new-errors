(new errors as in errors that appeared after compiler became fairly complete)


Should functions with the same union have the same type? I'm not sure.
	But, different types are likely with associated types. Like that error I had.
	Solution: also store the function parameters and return type alongside union. Do it with cucked unions too, as it's also possible. (todo: make a test for this, would be interesting.)
	If we were to more liberally generate unions (like, with each USE, also no need to backtrack), then this might become unneeded (maybe?????)???????

	ALSO, should we modify Scheme to also have function types? (i think so, as they can be instantiated to whatever... kinda. like, they can go through a datatype too) (todo: add a test for this!)
		So it seems like we should just turn functions into parameters!

Also, it turns out env expansion is busted. If we put it in a function and return the function, incorrect code will be generated (incorrect monomorphization). How do I solve this?
