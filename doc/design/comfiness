I've noticed that prefixing common iterator functions feels weird.
Like, kind of, should not happen.

	for x in Iter.range(1, 10)
	for x in 1 Iter.to (10)

vs

	for x in range(1, 10)
	for x in 1 to (10)

Seems clearer.
I can wildcard-import everything, but this seems uncomfy.

I guess for the user experience I should have some stuff imported by default.
