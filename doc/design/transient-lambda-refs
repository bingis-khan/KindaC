Basically, maybe, for lambdas, should we enable something like this?:

get-ref = x: &x

get-ref(420)
y = 111
get-ref(y)

currently, it doesn't make sense, because get-ref is a lambda function and the reference will only be valid in the lambda.
maybe ONLY FOR LAMBDAS, we should make something like this: (although, for the future, I'll need relevant useful examples, like code or people making this mistake).
we can compile this example like this:

x-ptr = &420
get-ref(x-ptr)

y = 111
y-ptr = &y
get-ref(y-ptr)


Like, maybe it's not bad! When refactoring code, we might put stuff into lambdas and this will break it if we're using references!
Same with environments!

x = 123
fn = :assign-num(&x, 420)


I think I've mentioned it somewhere??? I should find it.
Maybe the env one should happen for all functions!
